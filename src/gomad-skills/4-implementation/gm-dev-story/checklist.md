# 🎯 Enhanced Definition of Done Checklist

**Critical validation:** Story is truly ready for review only when ALL items below are satisfied

## 📋 Context & Requirements Validation

- [ ] **Story Context Completeness:** Dev Notes contains ALL necessary technical requirements, architecture patterns, and implementation guidance
- [ ] **Architecture Compliance:** Implementation follows all architectural requirements specified in Dev Notes
- [ ] **Technical Specifications:** All technical specifications (libraries, frameworks, versions) from Dev Notes are implemented correctly
- [ ] **Previous Story Learnings:** Previous story insights incorporated (if applicable) and build upon appropriately

## ✅ Implementation Completion

- [ ] **All Tasks Complete:** Every task and subtask marked complete with [x]
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Satisfaction:** Implementation satisfies EVERY Acceptance Criterion in the story
- [ ] **No Ambiguous Implementation:** Clear, unambiguous implementation that meets story requirements
- [ ] **Edge Cases Handled:** Error conditions and edge cases appropriately addressed
- [ ] **Dependencies Within Scope:** Only uses dependencies specified in story or project-context.md

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Unit tests added/updated for ALL core functionality introduced/changed by this story
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Integration tests added/updated for component interactions when story requirements demand them
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests created for critical user flows when story requirements specify them
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** Tests cover acceptance criteria and edge cases from story Dev Notes
- [ ] **Regression Prevention:** ALL existing tests pass (no regressions introduced)
- [ ] **Code Quality:** Linting and static checks pass when configured in project
- [ ] **Test Framework Compliance:** Tests use project's testing frameworks and patterns from Dev Notes

### Real-World Verification (when story has `## Real-World Verification` section)

- [ ] **Evidence filled — `real-world` mode:** If the story declares `Mode: real-world`, the `### Real-World Verification Evidence` slot under Dev Agent Record contains an entry per Real-World Verification row — actual command run + actual observed output / log excerpt / screenshot path. "All tests pass" alone is NOT acceptable here; the entry must reproduce real-system observation.
- [ ] **Evidence filled — `test-only-justified` mode:** If the story declares `Mode: test-only-justified`, the evidence slot contains the actual output of the *strongest available verification* the story named (test-suite run summary, before/after benchmark numbers, reviewer-reading note) — not just "tests pass".
- [ ] **Anti-Acceptance self-audit:** Confirm NONE of the Anti-Acceptance bullets in the story apply to your implementation: no mock-only test pass treated as evidence, no `console.log` of expected values in lieu of producing them, no TODO/FIXME in code paths reachable by an AC, no hardcoded fixture responses replacing real logic, no disabled/skipped/`.only`'d tests in changed files, no "compiles / type-checks" claimed as Real-World evidence. If any apply, HALT and report — do NOT mark Status=review.
- [ ] **Bar held, not lowered:** If you could not meet the Real-World Verification bar this story specified, you HALTED and reported (per the story's contract) — you did NOT redefine "done" to fit the implementation.

## 📝 Documentation & Tracking

- [ ] **File List Complete:** File List includes EVERY new, modified, or deleted file (paths relative to repo root)
- [ ] **Dev Agent Record Updated:** Contains relevant Implementation Notes and/or Debug Log for this work
- [ ] **Change Log Updated:** Change Log includes clear summary of what changed and why
- [ ] **Review Follow-ups:** All review follow-up tasks (marked [AI-Review]) completed and corresponding review items marked resolved (if applicable)
- [ ] **Story Structure Compliance:** Only permitted sections of story file were modified

## 🔚 Final Status Verification

- [ ] **Story Status Updated:** Story Status set to "review"
- [ ] **Sprint Status Updated:** Sprint status updated to "review" (when sprint tracking is used)
- [ ] **Quality Gates Passed:** All quality checks and validations completed successfully
- [ ] **No HALT Conditions:** No blocking issues or incomplete work remaining
- [ ] **User Communication Ready:** Implementation summary prepared for user review

## 🎯 Final Validation Output

```
Definition of Done: {{PASS/FAIL}}

✅ **Story Ready for Review:** {{story_key}}
📊 **Completion Score:** {{completed_items}}/{{total_items}} items passed
🔍 **Quality Gates:** {{quality_gates_status}}
📋 **Test Results:** {{test_results_summary}}
📝 **Documentation:** {{documentation_status}}
```

**If FAIL:** List specific failures and required actions before story can be marked Ready for Review

**If PASS:** Story is fully ready for code review and production consideration
