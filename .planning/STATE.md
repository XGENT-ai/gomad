# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-24 after marketplace workstream dropped)

**Core value:** A lean, properly-credited fork of BMAD Method that we own end-to-end and can extend with our own agents/skills.
**Current focus:** Phase 10 — story-creation-enhancements

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (story-creation-enhancements) — EXECUTING
Plan: Wave 1 complete (3/6) — 10-01, 10-03, 10-05 done; Wave 2 next (10-02, 10-04)
Status: Executing Phase 10 — Wave 2 pending
Last activity: 2026-04-25 -- Phase 10 wave 1 complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/3 v1.3 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- v1.2 shipped: 5 phases / 16 plans / 47 tasks / 133 commits over ~6 days (2026-04-18 → 2026-04-24)
- v1.1 baseline: 4 phases / 10 plans over ~12 days (2026-04-07 → 2026-04-18)

*Metrics updated at milestone close.*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

v1.3 roadmap decisions (2026-04-24):

- **Marketplace workstream dropped** — `gomad install` CLI is the single distribution path; `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` removed from the repo rather than refreshed. Former Phase 10 (MARKET-01..05) scrapped and logged in Out of Scope.
- **3-phase structure (coarse granularity)** — Phases 10 (Story-Creation), 11 (Docs), 12 (Agent Relocation + Release). AGENT-* and REL-* stay coupled in one phase because REL-02 quality gate depends on every AGENT-* test; AGENT-10 extends the release tarball-verify gate itself; CHANGELOG BREAKING is specifically about agent-dir.
- **Phase 12 is last with exclusive lock** — riskiest change (runtime pointer + cleanup-planner + namespace collision + latent `newInstallSet` bug). Needs Phase 10 `_config/<subdir>/` pattern proven and Phase 11 docs ready for path finalization.
- **DOCS-07 assigned entirely to Phase 12** — not split. Path-examples linter (`tools/validate-doc-paths.js`) enforces against real post-v1.3 layout.

Carried forward from v1.2 (logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions):

- **Launcher-form slash commands** — thin stubs load persona at runtime; v1.3 relocation changes the pointer target, not the pattern.
- **Generate-don't-move** — source dirs canonical; installed surfaces emitted at install time.
- **Zero new runtime deps policy** — load-bearing for v1.3 (BM25 hand-rolled, Levenshtein hand-rolled).
- **Manifest-driven cleanup + backup snapshots** — foundation for v1.2 → v1.3 agent-dir migration.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 12 research flag** — before `/gsd-plan-phase 12`, run `/gsd-research-phase 12` to resolve two open design questions: (a) `newInstallSet` derivation fix (AGENT-04) choice has cascading `buildCleanupPlan` effects; (b) `_config/agents/` collision resolution (AGENT-05) — Option 2 (detector tweak) is smallest-diff but confirm.

## Session Continuity

Last session: --stopped-at
Stopped at: Phase 10 context gathered
Resume: Run `/gsd-discuss-phase 10` then `/gsd-plan-phase 10` to begin planning Story-Creation Enhancements. For Phase 12, run `/gsd-research-phase 12` first (flagged in ROADMAP.md — open design questions on `newInstallSet` + `_config/agents/` collision).

**Planned Phase:** 10 (story-creation-enhancements) — 6 plans — 2026-04-24T16:49:16.599Z
